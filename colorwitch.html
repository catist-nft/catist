        <div class="colorwitch-stories">
        <p class="colorwitch-story">From now on I'm going to tell you the story of why I became a witch! No one might be interested, but it's my diary. WHO CARES! No one will peek at it, right? If someone peeks at my diary, I'll put a spell to make them good! Then at least they won't be able to gossip about me after peeking at my diary! So let's get started.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">I was just an ordinary student. What was a little unordinary was that I lived with three kittens I had brought from the street. In my repetitive daily life, I was able to get closer to the cats, and I thought that we understood each other.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">And I really liked to sleep. When I woke up, the sun was already high up in the sky. When I opened my eyes, I was greeted by my cute cats and colorful pictures that I liked.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">But that day was exceptionally strange because all the green in my room was gone. I quickly went to the window and looked out. Surprisingly, all the green color in the world was gone. All the leaves that were shining green turned to gray. At first, I thought there was something wrong with my eyes. However, the whole family was surprised and talked about it, and the news was full of stories that all had no green color. What was the cause? I thought I was lucky my cats weren't green.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">What was even more surprising was that the other colors also disappeared one by one as each day passed. Starting with green, yellow, blue, and purple disappeared one after the other. The colors of the world were meaningless, and paints were sprayed on the floor. I liked purple, so I was very sad.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">Eventually, all the colors disappeared, leaving only the red color. Red rubies began to sell like hotcakes, and more and more people wore red. Street signs also turned red. People were worried that the remaining red color would also disappear. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">It was night. I drew a red heart and attached it to the window. And I hugged my cats tightly. Then I lay in bed and thought about tomorrow. What if the red color disappeared tomorrow? I touched my bright red lips. Then I closed my eyes and thought of the green earth and the deep blue sea. I also remembered my favorite purple hoodie! Then I closed my eyes again.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">Then, suddenly, something unknown jumped up to the window with a thump. My Desk and picture frames shook. It was a slight tremor. Then, all of a sudden, the red things in my room started to glow brightly. I looked out the window and saw a dragon looking at me. An exceptionally bright red jewel was shining brilliantly on his forehead. ‘Oh my god! Dragons still exist in this world!’ Without realizing it, I screamed!</p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">“ Aargh! “ </p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">The dragon seemed to get used to surprising those who saw him. The dragon said, </p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">“ I am the last color left in this world. I might disappear too. A white-faced woman in a black cloak is searching for me. She has already taken all my friends. Now that I have no friends, I will be friends with you from now on! “</p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">As he finished speaking, suddenly a red cloud coiled around my body. At that moment, I was so surprised that I shouted!</p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">“ But we don't know anything about each other! How can we suddenly become friends? “</p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">Then the dragon said,</p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">“ Your cats boast about you every day that you make friends with every animal you meet for the first time on the road. “</p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">I had nothing to say. And looked at the dragon's face. I walked up to him and hugged him tightly. I still don't know why I did it then. I just hugged him like I did when I first hugged stray kittens on the street. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">The moment I hugged the dragon, my hair all turned red. And suddenly I was in a black dress. Was this dress black in the first place or was it a different color? When I got my mind, I found each cat was also wearing a strange accessory.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="colorwitch-story">This was our first meeting. After that, we went on a journey to find the colors that disappeared from the world. Until then, a lot of really crazy things had happened. And it seemed like a lot more crazy things were going to happen in the future. </p>
